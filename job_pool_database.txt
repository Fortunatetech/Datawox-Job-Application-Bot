Description: You will be provided with some scientific research papers from *ACL conferences. First, do not spend time for more than 10 minutes per paper to skim through the paper content. Now imagine that you would need to create a presentation for a 15 minute talk highlighting the research contributions and to promote the novelty of the paper, and how the authors of the paper have justified their claims. Now imagine that you would like to visually present the majority of the content so that the audience remains engaged and can grasp the content within a short amount of time. You can think of creating new diagrams to highlight the main content of the paper. Otherwise, if you find that there are existing tables or figures in the paper, you might also think of reusing the content to put it into the slides. You may want to present some tables into plots, or even create new flowchart or tables. Read the following papers and answer the following questions:

Title: AI Image Matching - Test if products are the same
URL: https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Image-Matching-Test-products-are-the-same_~0164998d80e1524394/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/
Description: PLEASE DO NOT BID ON THIS IF YOU HAVE NOT DEMONSTRABLE EXPERIENCE OF DOING IMAGE MATCHING PREVIOUSLY. ALSO UPWORK IS FULL OF BOTS AUTOMATICALLY BIDDING AND USING CHATGPT OR SIMILAR. IT'S ANNOYING :) ANYONE WHO USES A BOT WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY REMOVED We have a database which lists products (split into two products per record) and we need to check if two products are the same product. We wish to do this using the image of the two products - we only have the image URL and have not downloaded the image itself I can provide a link to this for anyone who is shortlisted We would like to find someone who can help us and suggest tools that we can use to: - automatically tag products - automatically determine if the image is of the same product or type of product The database we have is around 1700 records, but here is an example of the products: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12KpDW94ZT_3rrKX3y7eORVERhT_c_KvChhCAwqnN_sM/edit?usp=sharing Hopefully you will be able to see the two image URLs that need to be compared. We are happy for you to use a few different technologies as a test to look at quality of results, but also are ideally looking for someone with existing experience. We see the following stages: - Initial conversation about requirements and to ensure we both understand each other - Suggestions from you on tools that we should try (and anything we need to sign up for) - You taking the database and testing it - Final result would be for you to educate us on the process and provide any example scripts There is a MUCH wider project for the right person who is deeply embedded in the AI world! Please do not provide a 'copy & paste' message as these are obvious and we will reject anything like this. We will always reply to genuine applications. NOTE: Please don't ask me for a meeting/call immediately. Happy to do that once I have created a shortlist

Description: Overview: We have a vision system in place that captures high-resolution images of tire cord fabric using a line scan camera. The images are captured at a speed of 100 meters per minute. We are looking for a skilled freelancer to develop solutions for defect identification, width measurement, and mesh measurement on these images. Milestone: Defect Identification and Width Measurement. Mesh Measurement. Deliverables: Defect Identification: Develop an algorithm that can learn the characteristics of good fabric and identify any anomalies or defects in the fabric. The algorithm should account for natural variations in the fabric without generating false positives or negatives. Width Measurement: Develop a tool that accurately measures the width of the fabric in each captured image. The measurement accuracy should be within ±5mm. Mesh Measurement: Implement a method to count the number of warp and weft threads within a given area of the fabric. This measurement should be accurate and adaptable to different fabric densities. Software Environment and Requirement : Halcon (MVTec) - Can be used Deeplearning(object detection, segmentation, anomaly detection) - Can be used Operating System (Ubuntu 20.04) Language (c++) Total cycle time for (defect detection, width measurement, mesh measurement ) should be less than 50 to 70 ms on the below specified hardware. Because the system captures (12fps of 4096x1024).
