URL: https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Manual-Tester-for-Medical-Web-Application_~01a6210d0229dc72b8/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/
Description: We are a fast-moving team developing an electronic health record (EHR) platform. We are seeking a detail-oriented Manual Web Application Tester to help ensure the quality and stability of our platform through consistent and thorough testing. Responsibilities: Execute an end-to-end test script of the EHR platform at least three times per week. Record your screen during each testing session to capture all actions and interactions with the platform. Identify and log any issues or bugs encountered during testing by noting the timestamps in the recorded video. Provide detailed feedback on the usability and functionality of the platform. Work closely with our development team to update and expand the test script as new features are added. Communicate any issues or inconsistencies promptly to help the team identify and resolve them before production releases. Expectations: You will initially follow a simple test script, which will evolve as more features are integrated into the platform. Your work will directly impact our release schedule, as you will help us identify any breaking changes in new updates. We typically perform three production releases per week, so timely and accurate testing is critical. As the platform grows and the test script becomes more complex, the frequency of testing may increase. You are comfortable communicating asynchronously and using Loom video. Qualifications: Previous experience in manual web application testing, preferably with complex platforms such as EHR systems. Strong attention to detail and ability to identify subtle issues. Excellent communication skills and ability to provide clear, concise feedback. Familiarity with screen recording tools and bug reporting practices. Ability to work independently and meet tight deadlines. Additional Information: This is an ongoing role, and we’re looking for someone who can commit to regular testing each week. Flexibility in scheduling and the ability to adapt as our needs evolve are highly valued.
